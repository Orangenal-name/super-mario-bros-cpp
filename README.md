# super-mario-bros-cpp
I have never used c++ before so I decided it would be a fun challenge to try to recreate the classic super mario bros. 1 in it. I have started out using the SFML library but could switch to another one and start over if it doesn't go too well.


The current latest version will have already been built wither in the debug or release folder. (currently it is on the debug folder.)
